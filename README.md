# meg-laterality-for-Brainstorm
This repository hosts a Brainstorm-compatible pipeline designed for analyzing brain laterality using magnetoencephalography (MEG) task responses. The pipeline leverages Brainstorm, a popular MATLAB toolbox, to facilitate the robust analysis of hemispheric differences and lateralization in brain activity.
